# README

This is a simple ruby on rails blog that I build folling the guidelines in videos from [this](https://www.udemy.com/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-for-complete-beginners/learn/v4/) Udemy course online. I stopped near the end when it came to styling the website because I couldn't find the exact Bootstrap templates the course instructor was using to copy and paste. This make it so I was tinkering with html and I didn't want to spin my wheels for too long. The links and structure of the site should work fine.

Some of the files buried in the directories that I actually wrote the code for are as follows:

* [posts controller](https://github.com/taylorandrews/ruby_on_rails_blog/blob/master/app/controllers/posts_controller.rb)
* [routes](https://github.com/taylorandrews/ruby_on_rails_blog/blob/master/config/routes.rb)
* [show page](https://github.com/taylorandrews/ruby_on_rails_blog/blob/master/app/views/posts/show.html.erb)
